## 🧠 What I Learned

### 1. Final System Audit Script
- Created a complete Linux system audit script (`final_audit.sh`)
- Collected key system health metrics:
  - Host info, uptime, CPU, memory, disk usage
  - Top processes by memory & CPU
  - Login attempts and user activity
  - Yum updates and security patch advisories

### 2. Permissions & Ownership Refresher
- `chmod`, `chown`, `chgrp` usage
- Special permissions:
  - **setuid**, **setgid**, **sticky bit**
- Explored permission audit strategies
